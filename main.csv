To be candid, our engine has not been firing uniformly, and through disjointed effort has created inefficiencies that has resulted in unproductive capital expenditures, cost overruns and inefficient decision making to name a few. We believe that the solution is centralization but our ability to do so requires many different facets to be established. With the downsizing of Alpine 4 and a more refined focus, we believe that our ability to create and implement a more robust centralization plan is obtainable. For reference, a centralization of accounting, finance, purchasing, and HR offers several significant benefits that can streamline operations and enhance strategic alignment. By consolidating decision-making authority at the top levels of our organization, Alpine 4 can achieve a more unified direction and vision, ensuring that all parts of the business work cohesively towards common goals.This top-down approach will lead to more efficient allocation of resources as decisions regarding investments, cost-cutting, and prioritization of projects are made with a comprehensive understanding of the company's overall strategy and objectives. Centralization also simplifies the communication process, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation and ensuring that policies and procedures are uniformly applied across the organization. Furthermore, it allows for quicker decision-making in response to market changes or competitive pressures, as fewer individuals are involved in the approval process. This can be particularly beneficial in the industries we serve where speed and agility are critical to maintaining competitive advantage. Over the next six months, management anticipates that the Company will bring in-house much of our accounting, finance, and HR processes to our Corporate Office in Phoenix, AZ. This will allow our subsidiaries to focus on their key objective which is profitable sales. </span></div><div style=""height:72pt;position:relative;width:100%""><div style=""bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%""><div style=""text-align:right""><span><br/></span></div></div></div><hr style=""page-break-after:always""/><div style=""min-height:48.96pt;width:100%""><div style=""text-align:center""><span><br/></span></div></div><div><span style=""color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%"">As we continue to push forward into 2024, you will see that our subsidiary holdings and direction of Alpine 4 change, with the overall goal of positioning Alpine 4 as a technology centric company.

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions, projections and management&#8217;s beliefs that are subject to change.

Factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: risks attendant to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, including the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain court approval from the Bankruptcy Court with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court throughout the course of the Chapter 11 process; the effects of Chapter 11, including increased legal and other professional costs necessary to execute the Chapter 11 process and on the Company&#8217;s liquidity and results of operations (including the availability of operating capital during the pendency of Chapter 11); the length of time that the Company will operate under Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of Chapter 11; the Company&#8217;s ability to continue funding operations through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, and the possibility that it may be unable to obtain any additional funding as needed; the Company&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations during the Chapter 11 process and to maintain contracts that are critical to its operations; the effect of the Chapter 11 filings on the Company&#8217;s relationships with vendors, regulatory authorities, employees and other third parties; possible proceedings that may be brought by third parties in connection with the Chapter 11 process and risks associated with third-party motions in Chapter 11; employee attrition and the Company&#8217;s ability to retain senior management and other key personnel due to the distractions and uncertainties; the impact and timing of any cost-savings measures and related local law requirements in various jurisdictions; and the impact of litigation and regulatory proceedings.
