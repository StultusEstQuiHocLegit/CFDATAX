# CFDATA

This project gathers bankruptcy related 8‑K filings from the SEC EDGAR system and enriches them with company metadata and historical financial data.

Three CSV files are produced (and reports as attachments can be saved too if the correspoding part is commented in / activated) for bankrupt companies when running `DataCollector0.php`: `main.csv`, `financials.csv` and `reports.csv`.
In addition, we also select solvent/healthy/non-bankrupt companies and save their information in: `main_solvent.csv`, `financials_solvent.csv` and `reports_solvent.csv`, whereas in `main_solvent.csv` of course not all columns are filled out (only the columns regarding general company information).

## DataProcessor1.php

`DataProcessor1.php` calls the OpenAI API to rate the expected likelihood of bankruptcy for each company-year in `financials.csv` and `financials_solvent.csv`. It runs two rounds per row per batch: the base round uses only the original financial columns, while the extended round also includes the derived ratios and scores. Before sending data to the model, `idpk` is removed and `CIK` is renamed to `CompanyID` to decrease payload size and increase clarity. The resulting percentages are stored in the rows `AIExpectedLikelihoodOfBankruptcyBase` and `AIExpectedLikelihoodOfBankruptcyExtended`, which are added to both CSV files correspondingly.

**Note:** For replication, before running the script, edit `config.php` and replace `SAMEPLACEHOLDERFORTHEAPIKEY` with your actual API key.
